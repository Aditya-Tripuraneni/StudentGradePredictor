# StudentGradePredictor
Using machine learning this model  can predict the grades of students based on their study time, absences, free  time, failures, health, and grades they got in semester  1 and semester 2.
This is nothing fancy the model used was a linear regression model. At the time of creation I only new linear regression. I now know Linear regression, multiple linear regression, polynmomial regresison and support vector regression. Just need to learn the math behind the support vector regression.
